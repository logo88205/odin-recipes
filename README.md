# odin-recipes

Project: Recipes
This is my first project for the odin project fundamentals course.
I'm 35 & live in Birmingham, AL. I just recently quit my job as a mechanic/supervisor of 15yrs, to find a career I enjoy.
I have always been intrested in all things tech. I have some basic knowledge of some HTML & CSS, but I hope that doing this courses will help me
gain the skills I need to hopefully find a career in this field.
