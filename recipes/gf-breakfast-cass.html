  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1lb pork breakfast sausage (I like Jimmy Dean)</li>
    <li>1 large shallot or 1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li> 6 large eggs</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li> 8oz sour cream</li>
    <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>8oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided</li>
    <li> 4 cups (about 20oz,) frozen shredded hash browns, thawed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees then spray a 9x13" baking dish with nonstick spray and set aside.</li>
    <li>Brown sausage with shallot in a large skillet over medium-high heat then drain if desired and set aside to cool
      slightly (can be done ahead of time.)</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper in a very large bowl, add sour cream and milk, and then whisk until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add 3/4 of the shredded cheese (about 6oz,) the cooked sausage, and thawed hash browns to the bowl then stir to
      combine.</li>
    <li>Pour mixture into prepared baking dish then smooth with a spatula until liquid is evenly distributed. Sprinkle
      remaining cheese on top then cover with foil</li>
    <li>Bake for 1 hour, to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a knife
      inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Remove foil then bake for 5 more minutes or until top is golden brown.
      Let sit for 5 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    <li>If the mixture seems a little too dry before pouring into the casserole dish, add another one or two eggs
      whisked
      with milk.</li>
  </ol>
