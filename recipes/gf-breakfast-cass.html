        <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees then spray a 9x13" baking dish with nonstick spray and set aside. Brown sausage with
      shallot in a large skillet over medium-high heat then drain if desired and set aside to cool slightly (can be done
      ahead of time.)</p></li>
   
    <li><p>Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper in a very large bowl, add sour cream and milk, and then whisk until smooth. Add 3/4
      of the shredded cheese (about 6oz,) the cooked sausage, and thawed hash browns to the bowl then stir to combine.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Pour mixture into prepared baking dish then smooth with a spatula until liquid is evenly distributed. Sprinkle
      remaining cheese on top then cover with foil and bake for 1 hour, to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a knife
      inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove foil then bake for 5 more minutes or until top is golden brown.
      Let sit for 5 minutes before cutting and serving.</p></li>

     <h3>Notes</h3>
     <p>If the mixture seems a little too dry before pouring into the casserole dish, add another one or two eggs whisked with milk.<p>
