    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips (I use dairy free chocolate chips)</li>
        <li>5 Tablespoons coconut oil (can sub butter, avocado oil, vegan butter, ghee)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup coconut sugar (can sub white, brown, or maple sugar)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup finely ground blanched almond flour</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder*</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>To mix in: 2/3 cup additional chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (can sub nuts)</li>
        <li>Optional: Coarse sea salt to sprinkle on top</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line an 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper or spray with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, gently melt chocolate and oil over low heat until smooth and glossy. Remove from heat
            and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together sugar and eggs 2-3 minutes, until the mixture is slightly lighter in color
            and until they pass the ribbon test.when you lift the whisk the mixture should stream down evenly in
            “ribbons.” If you rub the mixture between your fingers, it shouldn't be gritty. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients almond flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>When the melted chocolate mixture has cooled slightly, stir in the egg/sugar mixture into the saucepan of
            melted chocolate. Stir in vanilla and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in the dry ingredients and fold until just mixed.</li>
        <li>Fold in the additional chocolate chips, reserving a few to sprinkle on the top</li>
        <li>Pour batter into your prepared pan and smooth the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees 20-24 minutes, or until edges are set and the center is still ever so slightly
            underdone.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with coarse salt, if using, and allow brownies to cool before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
